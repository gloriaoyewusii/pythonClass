Top-down pseudocode: Determine the total tax for each of three citizens

Step-by-step refined process: Initialise variables
Input names of three citizens
Input earnings of three citizens
Use 15% tax rate for earnings less than or equal to 30,000 usd to determine tax
Use 20% tax rate for earnings greater than 30,000 usd to determine tax
Determine total tax
Display citizens' total tax.

Stage 2
Before the loop is created
Set variable total to 0; the taxes calculated will be added to total in the body of the loop.
Set counter to 1 because we have a definite number of users which is three. When the counter exceeds three, the loop terminates.

In the body of the loop
Initialise variable name to be inputed by the citizens.
Collect name of citizen.
Initialise variable earnings to be inputed by the citizens.
Collect earnings of the named citizen.
Repeat/loop collection two more times.

If earnings is less than or equal to 30,000 USD, determine tax using 15% tax rate. 
Tax amount = (Earnings * Tax rate)
Add tax determined to total.
If earnings is greater than 30,000 USD determine tax using 20% tax rate.
Tax amount = (Earnings * Tax rate)
Add tax determined to total.
Display total
